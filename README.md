## New PC setup using Windows Package Manager 

Since Windows Package Manager now covers almost all of what I need on a PC at setup, I've decided to rewrite the useful setup script I previously had using Chocolatey. 

Windows Package Manager transfers from machine to machine easily. Once Windows is up and running the AppInstaller just needs updating through the store first then this can be run in PowerShell. 

Credit to winstall.app for making this process much easier, if you're using Windows Package Manager it's an absolute essential.
